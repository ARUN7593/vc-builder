          Space: The foundation of any interior design. It involves
          understanding the physical space and how to use it effectively. Line:
          Lines guide the eye and create shapes in a space. They can be
          horizontal, vertical, or dynamic (like diagonal or curved lines).
          Form: Forms are shapes with volume, such as furniture or decor. They
          can be geometric or organic. Light: Essential for visibility and mood.
          Natural and artificial lighting are both crucial. Color: Influences
          mood and perception. Color schemes are carefully chosen to match the
          purpose and style of the space. Texture: Adds depth and interest.
